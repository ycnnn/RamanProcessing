# RamanProcessing
Quick Python implementation for analyzing Raman text map collected from Nanophoton Raman 11

# Important note
- This script is designed for mapping data generated by Nanophoton Raman spectrum. It may need tweaking data collected from other systems (e.g., Renishaw).
- Current no PL spectra analysis support.

# I am using Nanophoton Raman and has finished a scan. How to obtain txt data file?
In the computer with which the data is collected, open the `.npi2` file in Nanophoton Viewer and in the dropdown menu of `File`, choose `save as text maps`. There may be several warnings.

# Highlight
- Fast approximate fitting implementation of Raman spectrums to form a map
- Parallel processing ability enabled
# Future plans
- Implement PL fitting functionality.
- Implement accurate fitting with parallel processing support
- It is likely than the current Python curve fit package does not support multiprocessing accerelating. In this case I may switch to expectation-maximization (E-M) algorithm to speed up fitting.
