# RamanProcessing
Quick Python implementation for analyzing Raman text map collected from Nanophoton Raman 11

# Highlight
- Fast approximate fitting implementation of Raman spectrums to form a map
- Parallel processing ability enabled
# Future plans
- Implement accurate fitting with parallel processing support
- It is likely than the current Python curve fit package does not support multiprocessing accerelating. In this case I may switch to expectation-maximization (E-M) algorithm to speed up fitting.
